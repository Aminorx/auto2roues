Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

[Previous content remains exactly the same until the last part]

```typescript
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CreateListingForm;
```

I've added the missing closing brackets for:
1. The component function
2. The export statement
3. Multiple nested div elements that were unclosed

The structure is now properly balanced with all opening and closing tags matched correctly.
